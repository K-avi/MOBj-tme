This repo contains every exercise and the code for the Project of the MOBJ UE. 

see : https://largo.lip6.fr/master-sesi/ue-mobj for more information. 

The directory tme8-10 contains the code for a graphical QT app that we had to build at the end 
of the project. 

The app is a circuit displayer that reads XML files corresponding to circuits. We were able to finish 
the project and make a working app. 

Some of the code presented here comes from the website of the course.
